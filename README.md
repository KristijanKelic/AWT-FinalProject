# it-shop-app

This is the final project for the Advanced Web Technology course. I used the MEAN stack.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
NodeJS -> get it from (https://nodejs.org/en/)
angularCLI -> install it globally on your machine with npm install -g @angular/cli (install NodeJS first to get npm tool)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
To run everything you will need to do few steps:
1. First navigate to nodejs-awtproject and open terminal window there and install dependencies with npm install
2. Same as step one you will need to navigate to angular-awtproject and run npm install there also
3. After you have successfully installed everything navigate to nodejs folder and in your terminal run npm start to run restAPI locally, then navigate to angular folder and type ng serve -o in your terminal to serve client side application
4. Make sure you add images folder inside nodejs folder for file storing to work
5. Read the NOTE below
```

## NOTE

This app uses mongodb atlas, stripe and nodemailer. That means you need to provide some keys before running app.
My keys and tokens are stored in .env file which is not commited to GitHub.

```
For mongodb connection go to (https://cloud.mongodb.com) create new account, cluster and one user with access to read write any database.

For stripe you need to create account on (https://stripe.com). After that go to dashboard and create 2 test keys (1 public and 1  secret). Copy public key and paste it in angular-awtproject/src/app/auth/auth.module.ts in appropriate palce.

Finally you will have to create .env file in the root folder of nodejs-awtproject and set the variables:
1.MONGODB_USERNAME= <USERNAME FOR USER YOU CREATED IN CLOUD MONGODB>
2.MONGODB_PASSWORD= <PASSWORD FOR USER YOU CREATED IN CLOUD MONGODB>
3.STRIPE_SK= <SECRET KEY YOU GENERATED IN STRIPE>
4.JWT_SECRET= JWT secret is used for hashing jsonwebtoken, you can put here anything you want! (example MY_BIG_SECRET)
5.EMAIL_ADDRESS=<YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT>
6.EMAIL_PASSWORD=<YOUR GMAIL PASSWORD>

Note: Nodemailer will use gmail as a service for sending emails for reseting password.To make everything
work you need to turn off 2step verification on your gmail account and 'Allow less secure apps' must be toggled on!

That's it :-)
```
